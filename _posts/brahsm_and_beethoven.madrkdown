Q: Why do people say Brahms first symphony is as if it were Beethoven’s tenth symphony?

That's a beautiful and very deep question — one that touches on music history, psychology, and even a little drama.

Let’s go through it carefully:

---

### **Context:**

* **Beethoven** wrote **9 symphonies** (his Ninth, the "Ode to Joy," was seen as the peak of symphonic music).
* After Beethoven's death, **Beethoven became a *giant*** — like a god in the eyes of later composers.
* **Brahms** (born a few decades after Beethoven) **worshiped** Beethoven’s music and felt **crushing pressure** to live up to him, especially in the world of **symphonies**.

---

### **Brahms and his struggle:**

* Brahms **worked on his First Symphony for about 20 years**!
* He **kept abandoning drafts** because he didn't think anything was good enough compared to Beethoven.
* He once said (to a friend), something like:

  > "You have no idea how it feels to hear behind you the footsteps of a giant like Beethoven."

---

### **When Brahms finally finished his First Symphony (Op. 68, premiered 1876):**

* Listeners immediately noticed how **grand, serious, structured**, and **heroic** it sounded — very much like **Beethoven’s style**.
* The **first movement** is dark, heavy, full of struggling energy — much like Beethoven’s Fifth.
* The **final movement** has a **majestic, hymn-like theme** that **strongly echoes Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony** ("Ode to Joy" feel).

It wasn't a copy — Brahms was too original for that —
**but the spirit of Beethoven was deeply alive** in the music.

---

### **So when people say:**

> **"Brahms's First Symphony is like Beethoven’s Tenth,"**

they mean:

* Brahms picked up where Beethoven left off,
* Brahms "answered" the gigantic challenge Beethoven posed,
* Brahms managed to create a symphony that felt worthy of standing next to Beethoven's.

**It’s a huge compliment** — and it shows how much emotional, historical, and musical weight Brahms carried into that work.

---

### **Short version:**

* Beethoven’s 9 symphonies felt like a complete, unmatchable mountain.
* Brahms’s First Symphony was seen as the first real "next step" worthy of Beethoven’s legacy.
* It’s grand, heroic, emotional — a "spiritual continuation" of Beethoven's world.

**how Brahms’s final movement theme sounds close to Beethoven’s Ode to Joy!**
