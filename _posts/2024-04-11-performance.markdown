This is a short post on why performance measurement often backfire.  You are trying to foster a culture, and you decide to measure how close (or far) your organization is from that culture.  Although your intentions are good, you may be missing some aspect that could render your efforts useless.  Or worse, your efforts can backfire and you end up with a culture that is nearly opposite from what you wanted to foster in the first place.

We will walk through two ideas which, put together, lead to an interesting concept; the one of "you get what you measure."  We then close with what this could mean for your organization.


## Measurement influences behavior

Think about the difference between measuring the length of a house versus measuring people's kindness.
Unlike measuring inanimate objects, measuring [adaptive systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_system) is difficult.  The act of measuring influences the outcome.  So, if you measure kindness, people will tend to act kinder.  You can never get to the actual truth--there will always a bias in the measurement.
That can be good.  By measuring kindness, you get people to act kinder.  Win!

## A measurement is a proxy, not the actual attribute

A measurement is a proxy, not the actual attribute.

Going back to measuring kindness; the idea here is you can't measure kindness directly.  Kindness is an abstract concept.  You can perhaps try to quantify it by measure a proxy for kindness.  For example, maybe you measure whether a person makes charitable contributions, whether they send a message on your birthday, or whether they hold the door open for the next person in line.

One way to remember this is by the [Zen buddhist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen#cite_note-FOOTNOTESuzuki1997154-135) saying: "don't mistake the moon by the finger pointing at the moon".


## You get what you measure

The combination of (1) adaptive system and (2) measurement by proxy has a catchphrase: _you get what you measure._
Here is an exaggerated example:

You have a customer support center where people look into tickets that are created when a customer calls with a complaint.  You want to measure and improve the quality of this organization.
If you measure quality by how fast tickets are closed, analysts will find the easiest answers to the complains and close the ticket with "xyz is likely the culprit" without doing due diligence.  So customers will call back in with the same complaint, and new tickets will be opened for the same issue.  On paper, you are closing tickets faster than before, in practice, your customers are pretty frustrated.

So you decide to measure by how fast tickets are responded to (as opposed to closed).  Then someone will create a bot that fills the ticket with the message "Looking into it.." automatically so that all tickets get an initial response, never mind the fact that the response is useless.

Once you put a system in place to measure (1) an adaptive system that (2) can only the quantified via a proxy, then _you get what you measure_.  And what you measure is not necessarily what you want to foster.  No matter how complex you make the metrics, there will come a point where optimizing for the metric will clash with simply "doing the right thing." 

You are probably thinking: "I don't have this cynical view of people" or "the people I work with are not like you described".
You are right!  Your employees or co-workers are not like that now, but they will become once you put a performance measurement system into practice.  The reason is that performance measurement systems incentivize people to look after themselves.  All it takes is one bad apple.

That's because performance metrics put people in the spot.  They have to decide whether to "do the right thing" or to improve their metric.
May people will be altruistic.  They want to do the right thing.  Plus, if the company isn't doing well, no one will do well.  So it's logical to look after the health of the company.
But consider what happens when one person puts benefiting themselves over the "right thing".  People will take notice, yet most people will not change their behavior.  They will keep doing "the right thing" but they may decide to "do the right thing" somewhere else.  Over time, the frustration of seeing a bad apple benefit themselves will crumble your employees' motivation .  They will get tired of being put on the spot: "why do I have to choose between the right-thing and the metric?!  That's not unfair".

Over time, the system will select for the less altruistic of us, and eventually the company will look the opposite of what the performance measurement system intended to foster.

## What then

Okay.. but if we shouldn't measure performance, what can we do instead?

If the goal is to foster behavior, then create a culture that allows for this culture to flourish.  The shift is from _measuring people_ to _enabling them_.  Embrace the fact that none of this is a hard science and stop trying to put a number on something that can't be quantified properly.  Encourage discussions on culture.
