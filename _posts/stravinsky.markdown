Q: Was the sacre du printemps a radical shift in ballet?

Absolutely — **Igor Stravinsky’s** *Le Sacre du Printemps* (*The Rite of Spring*, 1913) was one of the most radical and disruptive moments in the history of ballet — **musically, choreographically, and culturally**. It shook the foundations of what ballet was thought to be.

---

### 🎵 **1. Musically Revolutionary**

Stravinsky’s score shattered expectations:

* **Rhythm:** Complex, shifting meters (like 5/8 or 7/8), heavy syncopation, and **brutal, irregular accents**.
* **Harmony:** Dissonance pushed to the limit, with **piled-up chords** and **bitonality** (playing in two keys at once).
* **Orchestration:** Raw, primal textures (think pounding drums, shrieking winds, and that famously eerie **bassoon solo** opening).

It sounded nothing like the graceful Tchaikovsky or Delibes ballets audiences were used to.

---

### 💃 **2. Choreographically Revolutionary**

Vaslav Nijinsky’s choreography for the Ballets Russes:

* Rejected the elegance and symmetry of traditional ballet.
* Dancers stomped, hunched, bent their limbs unnaturally.
* Movements drew from **pagan rituals**, not courtly dances.

It was **raw, earthbound**, and intentionally ugly at times — completely subversive.

---

### 😱 **3. The Riot**

At the premiere in Paris on May 29, 1913:

* The audience **rioted**. Boos, cheers, fights — police were called.
* Some hated it; others were exhilarated.
* It marked a cultural turning point: a **break with Romanticism**, a step into Modernism.

---

### 📍 **Impact and Legacy**

* *The Rite of Spring* became a **landmark of 20th-century music**.
* It inspired generations of composers (Bartók, Bernstein, even film scores).
* It changed what **ballet could be** — paving the way for modern dance and experimental movement.

So yes — *Sacre* was not just a shift in ballet, it was an **eruption**, a **provocation**, and ultimately a **transformation**.

Q: Is it illegal to re-arrange stars spangled banner?

Great question — and the short answer is: **no**, it is not illegal to rearrange *The Star-Spangled Banner*, but there are **important nuances** depending on context.

---

### 🇺🇸 **Why It’s Not Illegal**

* **Public Domain**: *The Star-Spangled Banner* (lyrics and melody) is in the **public domain**, since both are from the 19th century.

  * Lyrics: by Francis Scott Key (1814)
  * Music: from an older tune by John Stafford Smith

This means **anyone can arrange, adapt, or reinterpret** the anthem legally — for personal use, performance, or even commercial purposes.

---

### ⚠️ **Where It Gets Sensitive**

1. **Public Ceremonies or Government Events**

   * If you're performing the anthem at an official or patriotic event (like a sports game), certain institutions (e.g. the Department of Defense, the NFL, or local governments) may have **guidelines** about how it’s to be performed — often favoring more traditional versions.
   * Breaking these norms **is not illegal**, but it might cause **public backlash** or result in **not being invited again**.

2. **Disrespect or Protest**

   * Some re-arrangements might be perceived as disrespectful (e.g. Jimi Hendrix's famous Woodstock version with distorted guitar).
   * Such performances are protected under **free speech** in the U.S., even if controversial.
   * However, if done while under contract (like a paid performer at a national event), violating agreed-upon terms **could have professional consequences**.

---

### ✅ **So, What You *Can* Do**

* Create jazz, rock, classical, or experimental arrangements.
* Record and sell your version.
* Use it in films, videos, or performances.

Just know that **public reaction** — not the law — may be the bigger force to reckon with.

Q: Was Stravinsky arrested for re-arranging it?

That's a fascinating story — and a widely spread **myth**!

### 🕵️‍♂️ **No, Stravinsky was not arrested** for rearranging *The Star-Spangled Banner*.

But here’s the real story behind that rumor:

---

### 🎼 The Incident

In **1944**, Igor Stravinsky was living in the U.S. and arranged *The Star-Spangled Banner* for choir and orchestra. It was a harmonically rich, somewhat modern-sounding version — still respectful, but different from the traditional version.

He planned to conduct this arrangement with the **Boston Symphony Orchestra**.

### 👮 The Police Warning

Boston police, aware of an **old Massachusetts law** that discouraged “tampering” with national symbols — including altering the anthem — **warned** Stravinsky *before* the performance. The law was rarely enforced, but they advised him to avoid controversy.

So, **he voluntarily replaced** his version with the standard one.

---

### 📷 The Arrest Myth

The myth likely started when:

* A photo of Stravinsky getting fingerprinted (from a **different visa-related issue**) circulated.
* People linked it to the anthem incident.
* Over time, this turned into the false tale that he had been *arrested for rearranging the anthem.*

---

### ✅ The Truth

* **He was never arrested.**
* **The anthem arrangement exists** and has been performed and recorded.
* The myth lives on because it's such a compelling (and ironic) image: the radical modernist being punished for altering a symbol of American tradition.

Would you like to hear Stravinsky’s version of the anthem? It's quite beautiful in its own way.
