Welcome!  I want to share with you some things I've learned about computer science.  I hope to spark conversations, meet people, and have a bit of fun along the way.  I will try to strike a balance between practice and theory, rigor and accessibility.  I hope you'll enjoy.

My [first post is about memory models][mmp1].  Before we start, here is a recipe that is as much revealing about [my origins][vitoria] as it is tasty.  I came to it recently, after being introduced to Aperol.  I call it "Aperinha", since it is a variation on the [caipirinha][caipirinha] recipe.  Without further ado, you'll need:

- One lemon
- [Cachaça][cachaca]
- [Aperol][aperol]
- A dash of sparkling water
- One and a half tea spoon of honey
- Some slices of fresh ginger

1. Place the ginger and the honey in a mug.  Boil a bit of water and pour about an ounce over the ginger and honey, let it steep.
2. Peal back the lemon a bit, cut it in half lengthwise and cross-sectionally.  Place the lemon in a glass and squeeze and mash it a bit to get some of the juices out
3. Mix in one shot of cachaça, one shot of Aperol, and dash or sparkling water.
4. Mix in the ginger honey water.  Add ice and stir.


Now that you are feeling good, to the [first post][mmp1].
