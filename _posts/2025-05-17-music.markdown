Recently I started to learn to play the piano on my own.
With an app installed on my phone, I began the ABCs of piano playing from the very beginning.
Eventually I started having questions about music theory, and ChatGPT and Youtube have been great learning partners.
I've also used ChatGPT to explore musical topics that excited me.
I figured that being inspired by music in general would keep my motivation.
ChatGPT recommended me a book that is a conversation between a writer and a composer ([aboslutely on music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolutely_on_Music)).
The book openned a fantastic door for me, which I explored together with ChatGPT.
I would like to share this newly found space with you.
So here is a collection of conversations that I've had with ChatGPT on music.

- [postmodernism, the industrial revolution, and contemporary classical music] postmodernism.markdown
- [Mahler, philosophical music, and art] marhler_philosophical_music.markdown
- [Brahms and Beethoven] brahsm_and_beethoven.markdown
- [Period music] period_music.markdown

- [twelve tone music] twelve_tone.markdown
- [stravinsky _Le Sacre du Printemps_ and his arrest] stravinsky.markdown
