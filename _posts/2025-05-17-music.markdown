Recently I started to learn the piano on my own.
With an app installed on my phone, I began to learn from the very beginning.
Eventually I started having questions about music theory, and I started using ChatGPT and Youtube as learning partners.
I figured that being inspired by music in general would keep my motivation,
so I started reading a book,
:book: [Aboslutely on music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolutely_on_Music),
that is a conversation between the author and an orchestra conductor.
This book openned a fantastic door for me, which I continue exploring with the help of ChatGPT.
Here is a collection of conversations with ChatGPT that I've found interesting.

- [Postmodernism, the industrial revolution, and contemporary classical music](/music/postmodernism.html)
- [Mahler and what it means for music to be philosophical](/music/marhler_philosophical_music.html)
- [Brahms as a continuation of Beethoven](/music/brahsm_and_beethoven.html)
- [Period music and listening to subtleties](/music/period_music.html)
