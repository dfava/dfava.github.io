#### About me

I'm a fourth year PhD student in the [Reliable Systems group][psy], lead by [Olaf Owe][olaf], at the University of Oslo, Norway.  My research is about concurrency and, in specific, synchronization via channel communication.  Together with my advisor, [Martin Steffen][martin], we proposed a weak memory model inspired by the Go programming language.  Our formalisms helped unveil an [inconsistency][gobug] between the Go data-race detector's implementation and the Go memory model specification.  I plan to defend my thesis in December 2020.

Before joining academia, I worked in Silicon Valley for six years .  I was an engineer in the Platform Architecture team at Apple Inc., and in the Larrabee GP/GPU Post-Silicon Validation team at Intel.

I left Apple in 2013 to work with [Jim Whitehead][jim], who was early in using AI to predict the incidence of bugs in commits.  At the University of California, Santa Cruz, I worked on a [DARPA project][csfv] to gamify the discovery of program invariants.  This project lead me to reading about automated reasoning and theorem proving.

I obtained combined BS/MS degrees in Computer Engineering from the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT), New York.  I am originally from Vit&oacute;ria, ES, Brazil.
