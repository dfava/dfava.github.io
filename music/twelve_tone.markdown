Q: Have we talked about twelve tone music before?  What does that mean?

We haven’t yet — but I’d be glad to explain. **Twelve-tone music** (also called **dodecaphony**) is a 20th-century method of composition created by **Arnold Schoenberg** to organize music in a radically new way — without relying on traditional key centers like C major or A minor.

### Here's the basic idea:

Instead of using a key, **all 12 notes** of the chromatic scale (C, C#, D, D#, ..., B) are treated as **equals** — no note is more important than another.

### **How does it work?**

1. **A tone row is created**:
   The composer arranges all 12 notes in a unique sequence. For example:
   `E – F – G# – C – D – Bb – A – F# – G – C# – B – D#`

2. This row becomes the **foundation** for the entire piece.

3. The row can be used in different forms:

   * **Original (prime)** form
   * **Retrograde** (the row backward)
   * **Inversion** (flipping the intervals upside-down)
   * **Retrograde inversion**

4. These variations are used **melodically and harmonically**, but always keeping the order intact — **no note repeats until all 12 have been played**.

### **Why was this done?**

* Schoenberg believed traditional tonality had reached its limit.
* He wanted a system that had **logic and structure** but freed composers from the gravitational pull of tonic-dominant harmony.
* It was a response to **post-Romantic emotional overload** — a kind of clean slate.

### **What does it sound like?**

To many ears, twelve-tone music sounds **atonal** — meaning it **lacks a key** and can feel disorienting or abstract. It often sounds emotionally cool, angular, and cerebral.
